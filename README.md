SCHOOL - Project

#DESCRIPTION
The goal of the Sokoban project is to recode the Sokoban game, of course, in a version compatible with a Linux terminal.
To do this, the player has the ability to move boxes (represented by 'X's) by pushing them with his character (represented by a 'P') in order to fill all the rooms (represented by 'O's).
